# Your Home Repository!

This is your new virtual workstation. You will use this codespace for all assignments and projects, cloning in the assignments to this repository instead of creating new codespaces on each run. This _should_ dramatically increase the speed of loading the codespaces when working on assignments.

This will also allow you to practice using the terminal to navigate to files and folders.
